### About the project
This is FrontEnd part of some experimenting with GraphQl. I have heard so much about it, so i decided to test it out. 
The FrontEnd is Vue Based, with Apollo configuration. 

This is a simple task managment system. Where each user has its own tasks. It can login, logout, pagginate, edit, add, and delete task.
